# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: May 12, 2022 , Thursday

**Today's Progress** : Forked the github [repo](https://www.github.com/atiyabzafar/100-days-of-code). Set up a ML environment and initiated a jupyter notebook (See code dir.) Chapter 2 of Geron's book.

**Thoughts**: I will be going through Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow (O'Reilly) by Aurélien Géron It has been a long time goal for me to learn ML and going through this book. Chapter 1 I have read before. I am starting from Chapter 2, where we start a new project and finish it end to end.
